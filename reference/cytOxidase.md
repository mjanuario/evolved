# Cytochrome Oxidase sequences

`cytOxidase` is a set of homologous protein sequences from the GENE
cytochrome oxidase SUBUNIT 1 gene. This mitochondrial gene, often known
as CO1 (“see-oh-one”), plays a key role in cellular respiration. C01
contains approximately 513 aminoacids and has been used by previous
studies for reconstructing phylogenetic trees and estimating divergence
times in Metazoaria by assuming a molecular clock. Its 5' partition is
used for the ‘Barcoding of Life’ initiative, for instance. This dataset
is part of the package and is licensed under the Creative Commons

## Usage

``` r
cytOxidase
```

## Format

A object of class "ProteinSeq" with 17 entries, each representing a
different animal species

- names:

  Organism's popular name or a taxonomic classification

- sequence:

  Aminoacid sequence of length 513

## Source

Amino acid sequences were originally downloaded from genebank and later
curated and aligned by Daniel L. Rabosky.

## Details

The object of class "ProteinSeq" is structured as a named `vector` of 17
different animal species, with each individual component being a
sequence of 513 aminoacids.
